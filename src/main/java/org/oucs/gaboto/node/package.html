{@link org.oucs.gaboto.entities.GabotoEntity}s are java representations of objects from the Gaboto ontology. For each
class in the OxPoints ontology there has to be a corresponding java representation. These
{@link org.oucs.gaboto.entities.GabotoEntity}s follow the convention of JavaBeans (see 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBeans">JavaBeans on Wikipedia</a>) and can be 
dynamically generated from the corresponding RDF or used to create RDF.
</p>
<p>
Beans consist of get and set methods for each attribute  and additional annotations. 
The annotations are then used by Gaboto to either generate entities from the RDF, RDF from
entities or to transform entities into a different output format (e.g. 
<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/">KML</a>).
</p>
<p>While {@link org.oucs.gaboto.entities.GabotoEntity}s are representation of Gaboto objects
at a specific point in time, {@link org.oucs.gaboto.entities.GabotoTimeBasedEntity} represent
an Gaboto object over its lifespan.
</p>
<p>
{@link org.oucs.gaboto.entities.GabotoTimeBasedEntity}s are used to set and change
timebound properties or can be used to display the changes of an entity over time.
</p>
<p>
GabotoBeans are simple objects following the convention of Java Beans (see the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBeans">wikipedia article</a>). They represent
complex properties for {@link org.oucs.gaboto.entities.GabotoEntity} that cannot be represented using 
binary relationships (or in other words, need blank nodes and more than one rdf triple
to be represented in the RDF Graph).
</p>
<p>
An example for such a complex property would be the address of a building. As an example
of how addresses could be stored in RDF, see the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-primer-20040210/#structuredproperties">RDF Primer</a>.
