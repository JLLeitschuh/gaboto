GabotoBeans are simple objects following the convention of Java Beans (see the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBeans">wikipedia article</a>). They represent
complex properties for {@link org.oucs.gaboto.entities.GabotoEntity} that cannot be represented using 
binary relationships (or in other words, need blank nodes and more than one rdf triple
to be represented in the RDF Graph).
</p>
<p>
An example for such a complex property would be the address of a building. As an example
of how addresses could be stored in RDF, see the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-primer-20040210/#structuredproperties">RDF Primer</a>.
