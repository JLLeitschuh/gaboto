{@link org.oucs.gaboto.entities.GabotoEntity}s are java representations of objects from the Gaboto ontology. For each
class in the OxPoinits ontology there has to be a corresponding java representation. These
{@link org.oucs.gaboto.entities.GabotoEntity}s follow the convention of JavaBeans (see 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBeans">JavaBeans on Wikipedia</a>) and can be 
dynamically generated from the corresponding RDF or used to create RDF.

<p>
Since adding new entities to the system should be a simple task, {@link org.oucs.gaboto.entities.GabotoEntity}s are
kept very simple. They only consist of get and set methods for each attribute that can be stored
for that particular entity and additional annotations. These annotations are then used
by the Gaboto system to either generate the entities from the RDF, to generate RDF from
entities or to transform entities into a different output format (e.g. 
<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/">KML</a>).
